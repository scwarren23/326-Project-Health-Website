## Group 23
## Health Hub : An Exercise/Nutrition Platform


# Problem: 
Thereâ€™s lots of apps out there that do separate things related to fitness, such as track nutrition, recommend workouts, demonstrate exercises, etc. which can get confusing.
# Solution: 
Consolidating physical and nutritional information to one website for people looking to stay healthy.
# Key Features:
Workout suggestions and demonstrations targeted towards muscle groups, calorie deficit/surplus calculator, nutritional advice, workout tracker (miles on a run, weight and sets, etc)
# Why this project?: 
We have seen how many newcomers to approaching their fitness journey can be overwhelmed by the amount of information and trends out there, so we want to provide a good starting point for tackling workouts, nutrition, and overall maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
