## Group 23
## Health Hub : An Exercise/Nutrition Platform


# Problem: 
Thereâ€™s lots of apps out there that do separate things related to fitness, such as track nutrition, recommend workouts, demonstrate exercises, etc. which can get confusing, especially for people trying to get into fitness. This overflow of information can make getting into fitness, or just trying to stick to a routine, difficult.
# Solution: 
Consolidating physical and nutritional information to one website for people looking to stay healthy.
# Key Features:
Workout suggestions and demonstrations targeted towards muscle groups, food tracker, nutritional advice that features a calorie calculator, workout tracker (miles on a run, weight and sets, etc)
# Why this project?: 
We have seen how many newcomers to approaching their fitness journey can be overwhelmed by the amount of information and trends out there, so we want to provide a good starting point for tackling workouts, nutrition, and overall maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
